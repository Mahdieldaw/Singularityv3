<narrative>
The models converge on a fundamental shift: transforming Singularity from a static cartographer into a **dynamic thinking partner**. While your Unfolding framework already rejects the oracle model, the responses reveal that true cognitive augmentation requires the landscape itself to be reactive, not merely observable.

**[Topological Clustering Algorithm|claim_5]** emerges as the computational anchor. Models 3 and 4 agree that your Computation Layer must evolve beyond pattern detection to geometric classification—measuring semantic distances to programmatically determine whether the answer space forms a Hub, Chain, or Polarized field. This automated shape-detection becomes the scaffolding for everything downstream. **[Variance Scoring for Floor/Tension|claim_9]** extends this: high-agreement clusters solidify as the Floor, high-variance clusters pulse as Tension. The mathematical separation of consensus from conflict automates the cognitive relief you describe.

Yet a critical tension exists around **temporality**. **[Choreographed Temporal Reveal|claim_18]** advocates preserving your six-beat structure as attention management—even if computation finishes instantly, the interface breathes information out to prevent cognitive overwhelm. But **[Nonlinear Information Unfolding|claim_17]** challenges this: why lock users into fixed beats when their interactions could determine what emerges next? And **[Cognitive Tension Earlier|claim_26]** questions whether the Floor should even appear before the Tension—perhaps showing pressure immediately after reframing would spark faster engagement. This is a tradeoff between structured guidance and responsive exploration.

The Reflection step receives the sharpest refinement. **[Reflection as Assumption Interrogation|claim_1]** argues that revealing hidden dimensions isn't enough—the system should expose the assumptions embedded in the question itself, offering multiple reframes. "Should I use React or Vue?" assumes both are viable and that framework choice matters most. What if the real question is "Should I build this at all?" **[Interactive Reflection Confirmation|claim_2]** makes this collaborative: users select which reframe resonates, turning orientation from broadcast into co-construction. **[Reflexive Reframe Pre-Computation|claim_25]** suggests automating this through a fast pre-computation pass that analyzes the user's prompt against the tension to identify governing variables.

The Shape layer gains dimensionality. **[Confidence Topology in Shape|claim_3]** notes that polarization itself has texture—a sharp binary where models deeply divide looks different from a soft gradient where they slightly lean. Visual intensity should encode this: dense versus diffuse nodes, thick versus thin edges. **[Animated Shape Dynamics|claim_4]** goes further: subtle motion conveys relational logic faster than static glyphs. Poles pulling apart signal polarization; pulses radiating from a hub indicate centrality. These leverage pre-attentive processing—the mind grasps structure before conscious parsing.

The Floor and Edges receive contradictory enhancements. **[Editable Ground Layer|claim_7]** and **[Adaptive Grounding|claim_8]** both advocate making the Floor mutable—users should annotate contradictions they know from context, turning passive relief into active calibration. Yet the Floor's power comes from being settled. Models diverge here: should the ground be stable (your original vision) or should it evolve as users validate it (the proposed enhancement)? **[Contextual Weighting of Edges|claim_13]** suggests visual cues should emphasize singularities that challenge the floor with intense color while muting blind spots. But **[Edges as Ambient Signals|claim_14]** argues against waiting for attention—use peripheral glows and pulses to gently draw curiosity without disrupting focus. The tradeoff: explicit hierarchy versus ambient discovery.

Tension becomes interactive through **[Tension as Interactive Gradient|claim_10]**—render it as a slider revealing conditional outcomes when dragged. "If you value hiring > onboarding, React wins; if velocity > talent pool, Vue wins." **[Spatial Tension Visualization|claim_11]** adds urgency through dynamic graphs and color shifts. This transforms tension from a revelation of structure into a **manipulation surface**—users don't just see the pressure, they apply force to it.

The Edges layer gains three distinct enhancements. **[Edges as Interactive Probes|claim_12]** turns blind spots into action: when the system reveals "No model asked about your current stack," offer to re-query with that constraint. **[Shadow Layer of Adjacent Territories|claim_15]** introduces questions the system *almost* asked—adjacent problem spaces appearing as faint portals, revealing that "Should I use React or Vue?" exists within a larger topology of API architecture and team composition decisions. **[Visualized Negative Space|claim_16]** makes absence explicit: blind spots rendered as fog of war, outlining holes in reasoning as distinct geometric entities rather than hiding what the system doesn't know.

**[Resistance Points for Validation|claim_6]** introduces friction: after the Floor appears, pause and ask "Is this foundation solid for your context?" This transforms scrolling into validation, creating checkpoints where users can redirect if their context diverges from model assumptions. Yet this risks breaking flow—a tension between ensuring engagement and maintaining rhythm.

The Invitation layer splits into two directions. **[Structurally Generative Prompts|claim_19]** argues prompts should help users map concrete constraints onto abstract tensions: "Which side does your actual situation push you toward?" **[Personalized Thinking Prompts|claim_20]** uses past interactions to make invitations resonant: "Given your team's Python background…" Both reject generic contemplation for context-specific instantiation.

Three supplemental enhancements push beyond your original scope. **[Recursive Terraforming|claim_21]** makes prompts reshape geometry—clicking "What if the singularity is right?" moves it to center as new Ground, making previous consensus peripheral. **[Dynamic Lens Mechanism|claim_22]** adds filters for constraints like Safety versus Novelty: as users adjust lenses, the Ground shrinks and new Edges flare, teaching that truth depends on priority hierarchy. **[Source Texture Preservation|claim_23]** retains model signatures as visual veins, letting users toggle influence to see how the landscape shifts if they ignore conservative voices or amplify creative ones. These transform the static map into a **responsive instrument**.

**[Semantic Zoom Hierarchy|claim_24]** provides depth control: geometry at highest zoom, headlines next, then arguments, then raw logs at deepest level. This satisfies both executive orientation and engineer verification without cluttering the default view.

Yet **[Synthesis as Reflective Decision|claim_27]** reminds that even optionality requires intention. Frame synthesis not as available-if-wanted but as a conscious choice preceded by reflection prompts: "Do you need this space collapsed, or has the landscape itself clarified your thinking?"
