"### 1\\. \\<narrative_summary\\>\n\nThe survey of the territory reveals a fundamental convergence: the Artifact Showcase must transition from a static inventory to a **Relational Landscape**. The emerging consensus establishes that **workflow logic (edges)** is a more potent navigational beacon than **taxonomy (dimensions)** [2, 5, 6]. By prioritizing how ideas connect over what they are called, the map transforms from a list into a \"proto-strategy\" [4].\n\nThe topographical meridians align around **Relational Clustering**. Most perspectives agree that complementary and prerequisite items should be physically \"docked\" or \"fused\" into shared visual containers [3, 5, 6]. This creates a \"spine\" or \"rail\" effect where dependencies are felt through vertical flow and indentation rather than read through labels [1, 2, 4, 5].\n\nA significant bifurcation exists regarding **Dimensions**. While one school of thought proposes Dimensions as the primary \"rooms\" or \"rails\" that hold the clusters [3, 4], a dissenting and stronger signal argues that Dimensions must remain secondary metadata badges [2, 5, 6]. This ensures that critical dependency chains—like a \"Backend\" prerequisite enabling a \"Frontend\" feature—are not fractured across category lines [6].\n\nTensions are most visible at **Bifurcation Slots**, where conflicting options are staged as a \"dialogue\" or a \"fork in the road\" [3, 4, 6]. These points of friction are not just listed; they are \"staged\" to force a decision, using interaction-based \"Selection Radiance\" to dim the path not taken [3, 4, 5].\n\nThe **Ghost** remains the \"Great Void\" [4], a non-interactive negative space that separates the manifested options from the unaddressed path [3]. What remains unmanifested is a strategy for handling \"orphaned\" items, though the consensus suggests they act as \"Independent Anchors\" that provide a baseline for the more complex clusters [3, 6].\n\\</narrative_summary\\>\n\n### 2\\. \\<options_inventory\\>\n\n1.  **Implicit Spatial Grouping**: Use proximity, alignment, and shared visual anchors (borders/icons) to connect complementary items without explicit labels [1].\n2.  **Sequential Prerequisite Flow**: Order prerequisites vertically (A above B) using indentation and \"arrow-like\" indicators to signal enabling relationships [1, 2, 5, 6].\n3.  **Relational Clusters/Card Bundles**: Group connected items into unified visual containers or \"cards,\" treating the cluster rather than the row as the primary unit [2, 5, 6].\n4.  **Relationship-First Hierarchy**: Prioritize edges as the primary organizing principle over dimensions to reveal workflow over taxonomy [2].\n5.  **Conflict Side-by-Side (Bifurcation Slot)**: Present mutually exclusive options in a horizontal \"VS\" layout or \"choice capsule\" to signal a required trade-off [3, 4, 6].\n6.  **Selection Radiance/Gravity**: Use hover and selection states to highlight related partners (complements/prerequisites) or dim conflicting antagonists [3, 4, 5].\n7.  **Dimensional Headers (The Rail)**: Use dimensions as top-level structural buckets or \"rails\" that house internal relationship clusters [3, 4].\n8.  **Dimension as Metadata Badge**: Treat dimensions as muted secondary annotations on individual rows or clusters to prevent fracturing relationship chains [2, 5, 6].\n9.  **Independent Anchors**: Treat ungrouped items as standalone \"atoms\" or \"anchors\" that sit between or after clusters to signify their independence [3, 4, 6].\n10. **Tension Indicators**: Link frame challengers directly to the consensus claims they contradict via \"zigzag\" dividers or \"tension boxes\" [4, 6].\n11. **Negative Space Ghost**: Render the Ghost as a full-width, non-interactive visual \"void\" (e.g., diagonal hatch) to signal the unmanifested path [3, 4].\n    \\</options_inventory\\>\n\n### 3\\. \\<mapper_artifact\\>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"consensus\": {\n    \"claims\": [\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Relational Clustering: Group items connected by edges into shared visual containers or 'cards' to signal logical unity.\",\n        \"supporters\": [2, 5, 6],\n        \"support_count\": 3,\n        \"dimension\": \"layout_logic\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Vertical Dependency Flow: Order prerequisites sequentially with indentation or 'spine' lines to communicate flow.\",\n        \"supporters\": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6],\n        \"support_count\": 5,\n        \"dimension\": \"hierarchy\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Interactive Selection Feedback: Selection of one item should highlight partners (radiance) or de-emphasize conflicts (gravity).\",\n        \"supporters\": [3, 4, 5],\n        \"support_count\": 3,\n        \"dimension\": \"interaction\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Bifurcation Slots: Present conflicting options side-by-side or in 'choice capsules' to signal mutual exclusivity.\",\n        \"supporters\": [3, 4, 6],\n        \"support_count\": 3,\n        \"dimension\": \"layout_logic\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"quality\": \"resolved\",\n    \"strength\": 0.9\n  },\n  \"outliers\": [\n    {\n      \"insight\": \"Dimensional Headers: Dimensions should be the primary grouping buckets ('rooms') for clusters.\",\n      \"source\": \"Model 3\",\n      \"source_index\": 3,\n      \"type\": \"frame_challenger\",\n      \"dimension\": \"information_architecture\",\n      \"challenges\": \"Dimension as Metadata Badge\",\n      \"bifurcates_toward\": \"Taxonomic-first navigation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"insight\": \"Dimensions as Metadata: Dimensions should be muted badges to avoid splitting relationship chains across categories.\",\n      \"source\": \"Model 6\",\n      \"source_index\": 6,\n      \"type\": \"supplemental\",\n      \"dimension\": \"information_architecture\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"tensions\": [\n    {\n      \"between\": [\"Dimensional Headers\", \"Dimension as Metadata Badge\"],\n      \"type\": \"bifurcation\",\n      \"axis\": \"Primary vs Secondary Grouping\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"dimensions_found\": [\"layout_logic\", \"hierarchy\", \"interaction\", \"information_architecture\"],\n  \"topology\": \"dimensional\",\n  \"ghost\": \"A method for handling 'Ghost' items as selectable prompts to 'Explore the Gap' rather than just viewing the void.\",\n  \"query\": \"How should the Artifact Showcase use graph edge metadata (complements, prerequisites, conflicts) to organize related items in a list-based view?\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-12-31T03:52:20.361Z\",\n  \"model_count\": 6\n}\n```\n```"
