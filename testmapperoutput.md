### THE NARRATIVE

The governing variable for this audit is the **calibration of epistemic humility**—the tension between providing a clear structural "Single Voice" and inadvertently creating a false sense of certainty for the user.

The models present a **Dimensional** audit. While they converge on the robustness of the structural pipeline, they split across several "Refinement Lenses" regarding how that structure is communicated to the user. The primary floor is that the Concierge must move beyond summary into **Judgment Augmentation**.

#### The Ground: Settled Strengths

There is broad agreement that the "Transfer Question" is the most vital component of the architecture, as it effectively returns agency to the user. To maximize this, the models agree you should [Design Leveraged Non-Binary Transfer Questions|claim_7], ensuring the user is never given a simple "Yes/No" exit. Furthermore, the introduction of a [Logical Pivot Meta-Field|claim_9] is seen as a necessary structural bridge to make these transfers feel earned rather than abrupt.

#### The Tension: Confidence vs. Navigation

A significant conflict exists regarding the "Settled" and "Contested" defaults. While your guide suggests "speaking with confidence" in settled states, the consensus is to [Inject Epistemic Humility into Settled Shapes|claim_1] to avoid the complacency of groupthink.

In the Tense zone, the models challenge your "Default" stance, arguing that you must [Pivot Contested Default to Explore Stance|claim_2]. Rather than a neutral summary, the Concierge should [Adopt Stakes Architecture|claim_11], revealing that the "real decision" is a choice between irreducible risks. This ensures the user is choosing between costs, not just opinions.

#### Structural Refinements: The Singularities

Several high-connectivity insights refine specific shapes:

* **Keystones:** Do not assume a hub is fragile just because it is central. You must [Distinguish Centrality from Fragility|claim_3] to avoid dramatizing stable foundations.
* **Sequencing:** For linear paths, you must [Verify Causal vs Rhetorical Order|claim_4]. If the models only *reasoned* in a sequence, but the tasks are not interdependent, a linear walkthrough is a "Order Fetish."
* **Optimization:** In contextual scenarios, [Apply Branch-Convergence Checks|claim_6] to avoid stalling the user on context that doesn't actually change the final recommendation.

#### The Ghosts at the Edge

The models identified a potential "Lens Tyranny" in the Dimensional shape, suggesting you [Prevent Lens Tyranny|claim_5] by allowing users to integrate dimensions rather than always choosing a winner. Furthermore, a new shape is proposed: you should [Formalize Paradox Shapes|claim_8] for truths that remain contradictory but valid.

Finally, the map is silent on how to [Execute Pre-Mortem Failure Analysis|claim_10], a critical step for high-stakes reasoning that asks why the current "Singularity" might eventually be proven wrong.

**Would you like me to draft a revised set of System Instructions for the "Contested" shape that incorporates the "Stakes Architect" and "Explore Stance" refinements?**
