WRITE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 

The Definitive Cut/Keep/Consolidate Map
Based on full codebase analysis, here's exactly what's what, aligned with your vision of 3 real tabs (Graph, Narrative, Space) + a JSON dump drawer:

HARD DROPS (dead code / nothing consumes it / moot for V8)
What	Why it's a hard drop
dominantStance on nodes	Paragraph-level stance is meaningless. Nothing renders it.
contested on nodes	Same — never visualized, moot at paragraph granularity
strongDegree on nodes	Never rendered, no consumer
top1Sim / avgTopKSim on nodes	Debug-only similarity stats, never surfaced
oppositionPairs (preSemantic)	Geometric tension detection for claim-centric world — dead end, never consumed
guidingSignals (preSemantic)	Computed but never injected into mapper prompt — pure dead code
Peak/hill/floor tiering (regionProfiles)	Was for predicting claim support tiers. No consumer.
alignment result (splitAlerts, mergeAlerts, unattendedRegionIds)	Computed, logged, never surfaced to UI or concierge
metrics.ts — leverage, keystone, skew enrichment	Enriches claims with percentile flags nobody reads
patterns.ts — cascade risk, convergence points, isolation patterns, leverage inversions	Computed, shown only in debug accordions, concierge doesn't consume them
graph.ts — chain analysis, hub detection, articulation points	Graph topology analysis — concierge doesn't use it
Shape-specific data payloads (SettledShapeData, ContestedShapeData, etc.)	Per-shape deep analysis objects — never consumed downstream
classification.ts full composite shape + peak pair relationships	Elaborate shape classifier — can be replaced with 20-line version
Options tab	Claims-by-theme grouping — redundant once Space tab shows claims alongside source text
Ghost analysis (implied missing claims)	Shown in debug accordion, not consumed by concierge or traversal
KEPT BUT MINIMAL (minimum data for the consolidated Space tab)
What	Why it stays	What gets trimmed
regionId / componentId on nodes	Needed for hull rendering in Space view	Drop tiering, profiles, opposition
kNN edges	Already there, base graph layer for Space viz	Keep as-is
Mutual edges	You said keep these — adds visual edge layer + mutualDegree for node sizing	Keep mutualDegree on nodes, add mutual edge list to artifact
Strong edges	You said keep these — shows pruning-relevant connections	Add strong edge list to artifact
isolationScore on nodes	Could drive opacity for isolated nodes in Space	Keep, optional use
Completeness/coverage	{ indexed, orphan } count — becomes a filter state ("Orphan" filter) in Space tab	Drop the full CompletenessReport object, keep just the counts
Traversal graph	conflicts, conditionals, prerequisites, shape — traversal depends on it	Drop tiers/cycles/roots (concierge doesn't use them)
Forcing points	Pipeline pause logic depends on them	Keep as-is
Shadow delta/audit	Becomes filter states (unreferenced = orphan, delta = "changes" filter) rather than raw JSON dumps	Drop as separate panels, surface as filters
Shape classification	Keep the 20-line version: `convergent	forked
Conflicts + conditionals	Traversal consumes them	Drop the surrounding pattern detection apparatus
WHAT'S TRULY REDUNDANT (duplicate data in multiple places)
These appear twice currently — once in Pipeline Artifacts buttons AND in StructuralDebugPanel accordions:

Duplicate	Where it appears	Resolution
Completeness	Pipeline Artifacts button + Debug accordion	Once in Space tab as filter state
Traversal Graph	Pipeline Artifacts button + Debug accordion	Once — available in Space tab's pre/post traversal toggle
Forcing Points	Pipeline Artifacts button + Debug accordion	Once — in Space tab
Problem Structure	Pipeline Artifacts button + Debug accordion shape section	Once — in the JSON drawer
Full Structural Analysis	Pipeline Artifacts button + Debug accordion (entire thing)	Once — in JSON drawer if someone wants raw
YOUR CONSOLIDATED TAB STRUCTURE
Based on your vision:

Tab	What it shows
Graph	Claim graph (keep as-is)
Narrative	Mapper narrative output (keep as-is)
Space	The big merge: UMAP viz + region hulls + mutual/strong edges + statements alongside graph + fate coloring + source text panel with highlighting (click node → highlights source statements in text panel) + pre/post traversal toggle + concierge controls (what gets sent = chewed text preview) + filters: Referenced/Orphan/All, By Region, By Model, Changes
JSON	Raw data drawer — all 16 Pipeline Artifacts sub-buttons become expandable sections here. Mapper Artifact becomes "Export All" button. Each section viewable separately or all at once for copy/paste
The key insight from your description: Space becomes the single analytical view because:

Nodes highlight directly to source statements in a side panel (the shadow input batch display)
Post-traversal toggle shows what got chewed — which is exactly what concierge sees
No need for separate Concierge Pipeline panel because Space already shows the before/after
No need for separate Options tab because claims are visible on the graph with source text alongside
WHAT CHANGES IN THE SCHEMA
Per your plan, nothing in the schema shape changes except:

Add to geometry.substrate:

mutualEdges: { source, target, similarity, rank }[]
strongEdges: { source, target, similarity, rank }[]
Add to nodes post-traversal:

fate: 'protected' | 'skeleton' | 'removed' | 'orphan' | 'mixed'
Expand geometry.preSemantic from { hint: shape } to pass through regionization (for hull rendering), but NOT the full profiles/tiering

Everything else is pure UI rendering changes in DecisionMapSheet.tsx, ParagraphSpaceView.tsx, and killing StructuralDebugPanel.tsx as a separate entity.

THE CUT LIST FOR STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS FILES
File	Action
metrics.ts	Hard drop — leverage/keystone/skew enrichment consumed by nobody
patterns.ts	Hard drop — cascade risk, convergence points, isolation patterns, leverage inversions all dead-end in debug UI
graph.ts	Hard drop — components/chains/hubs are debug-only, concierge ignores them
classification.ts	Replace with 20-line classifyShape() inline
engine.ts	Gut to just: extract conflicts/conditionals/prerequisites → classify shape → done
The entire src/core/structural-analysis/ directory shrinks from 5 files to essentially one small function.

CRITICAL FINDING: CONCIERGE DOESN'T USE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AT ALL
The concierge prompt (ConciergeService.ts lines 202-285) receives only:

User message
Evidence substrate (skeletonized model outputs)
Conversation history
It does NOT consume claims, edges, structural analysis, patterns, shape classification, or any of the analysis pipeline output. The structural analysis only constrains what goes into the substrate via traversal. This means all those debug accordions and pattern detections are pure UI decoration — they inform the user, not the AI.

This validates your heavy cutting approach. The pipeline that actually matters is: shadow → paragraphs → embeddings → substrate → mapper → claims → traversal → skeletonization → concierge. Everything hanging off the side (analysis, patterns, metrics, profiles) is visualization-only, and most of it isn't even good visualization — it's raw JSON in accordions.

ok good write me an implementation plan, leave the options tab for now, because it has a way it links the claims to narrative text we can plan for consolidating that with spac tab after the main planning and execution. you can leave prerequisites as they are also, but note they are not actually used in traversal itself they are more like meta data or supproting data, as the mapper no longer outputs them and we are planning to reduce the analytical layer im not sure how we will still leverage them yet. with shapes your 20 liner is a bit sparse, id like to keep my broad categories not just convergent and forked. the categories should at least cover the range, i.e sparse, included maybe one or two others
